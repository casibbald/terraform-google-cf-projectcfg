# Changelog

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/casibbald/terraform-google-cf-projectcfg/compare/v2.4.1...v3.0.0) (2024-12-09)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* delete move blocks
* To match the Cloud Security Baseline, the module creates fewer firewall rules. Previously created firewall rules are **automatically removed**. The new input variable `firewall_rules` allows to configure which firewall rules are created.
* To comply with Security Policies, the module no longer grants the `roles/editor` role to the Compute Engine default service account. The previously existing toggle to remove this role from the service account is now removed, as this is now the default behaviour.
* The module no longer outputs METRO net blocks as those are fetched from an DNS record that is not very well maintained. Firewall rules should also not rely on the fact that traffic originates from METRO's public IPs to consider it trustworthy.
